Content:
 - iotse-components.yml = docker compose file for 8 component services of the IoTSE, 2 instances of Redis database, 1 instance of MongoDB, and also 1 instance of WSP (IoT platform for virtualising sensors) for simplicity. 
 - conductor-compose.yml = docker compose file for conductor server, ui, elastic search and and dynamic databases. This file is based on the instructions from Netflix's Conductor project.
 
Starting up commands:
1. docker stack deploy -c iotse-components.yml iotse-prototype
2. docker-compose -f conductor-compose.yml up -d

Note:
 - Avoid changing name of stacks, as names of networks which are hardcoded into compose files vary with the name of stack.
 - Due to unknown bug in Netflix's Conductor, it cannot be started as a stack. Docker compose is used until a solution is found.
 - The Conductor must be loaded with workflow definition before the IoTSE prototype is ready. Use the conductor clients provided in this package to push workflow definitions to Conductor.
